## isotypic.m:
Function\
Input n, output ndim\
Calculate each one and two-dimensional irreducible representation for Laplace-n and record the dimension of each as an entry for vector ndim

## check_isotypic.m:
Function\
Input N\
Check from 3 to 2*N\
Return value if some irreducible representation has dimension greater than 2 for some Laplace-n

## Experimental result:
None has any irreducible representation with dimension greater than 2, i.e., all irreducible representations of D_n are one or two-dimensional.
